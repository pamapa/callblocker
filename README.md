# callblocker
Blocks unwanted calls from your home phone, such as telemarketing, junk, spam, scam, etc.

The call blocker acts like a normal phone. No additional telephone switchboard (like FreePBX or Asterisk) is needed. When a telemarketer is calling, the call blocker picks up the phone and automatically hangs up after a few seconds. Like this the call is blocked. It's designed to run on devices with small footprints, such as a Raspberry Pi. When the call blocker is not running (e.g. hardware broke) your home phone is still working by design. Also it has the ability to check against online and offline phone spam lists.

## Install

### via Debian package
Download provided Debian package matching your OS.

```bash
apt install ./callblocker_*.deb
```

### via manual building
Follow [this instructions](/doc/development.md).


## <a name="webInterface"></a> Install web interface on Linux
The installation of the web interface is optional, the callblocker daemon works perfectly without it.
The web interface allows to view the caller log, change settings and diagnose problems. This instruction
explain howto setup it up with lighttpd, its also possible to configure it via apache.

Additional Debian packages are required:
```bash
sudo apt-get install lighttpd python3-systemd python3-setuptools python3-wheel
```

Prepare lighttpd, for additional information
see [here](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_ModFastCGI):
```bash
sudo pip3 install flipflop
sudo usermod -a -G systemd-journal www-data
sudo vi /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
```
- in the upper part you find the section 'server.modules='. Please add the module "mod_fastcgi" to it.
- make server.document-root point to "/usr/var/www/callblocker"
- at the end of this file add this code:
```section
   fastcgi.server              = (
        ".py" => (
                "callblocker-fcgi" => (
                        "bin-path" => "/usr/var/www/callblocker/python-fcgi/api.py",
                        "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd/fastcgi.python.socket")
        )
   )
```
- make sure the python file api.py has correct execution rights and restart lighttpd daemon.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart lighttpd.service
```


## Setup
There are two ways to connect the call blocker application with your phone system, depending if it is VoIP or analog. 

### Prepare your settings file
```bash
cd /etc/callblocker
sudo mv tpl_settings.json settings.json
sudo vi settings.json
sudo systemctl start callblockerd.service
```

### Setup using Fritzbox with an IP-phone
- create in the Fritzbox a new IP-phone
  - open your web browser and navigate to the URL http://fritz.box
  - in the menu "Telefonie -> Telefoniegeraete" click on "Neues Geraet einrichten"
  - choose "Telefon (mit und ohne Anrufbeantworter)" and click "Weiter"
  - choose "LAN/WLAN (IP-Telefon)", for name use for example "callblocker" and click "Weiter"
  - choose a password, remember it and click "Weiter"
  - choose "alle Anrufe annehmen" and click "Weiter"
- setup the IP-phone in the call blocker configuration ([/etc/callblocker/setting.json](/etc/callblocker/README.md)):
  - edit the section sip -> accounts
  - "domain":   "fritz.box"
  - "username": "your username"
  - "password": "your password"
  - make sure the account is enabled and the other fields are ok for you


### Setup using an analog phone
- attach the USB modem to the Raspberry Pi
- use `dmesg` to find the device name `/dev/<name>`
- setup the Analog phone in the call blocker configuration ([/etc/callblocker/setting.json](/etc/callblocker/README.md)):
  - edit the section analog -> phones
  - "device": "your device name"
  - make sure the account is enabled and the other fields are ok for you


## Configuration file
The documentation of the configuration file "settings.json" is located [here](/etc/callblocker/README.md).


## Offline blacklists
Through the web interface you have the possibility to maintain your own blacklist. Additionally there is the
possibility to download automatically an extern maintained blacklist for later offline usage. You will need to
setup a cronjob for this task to download the blacklist periodically.

Currently the following blacklists are supported:

Name                         | Site                       | Description
----                         | ----                       | -----------
blacklist_toastedspam_com.py | http://www.toastedspam.com | Mostly USA and Canada (+1)
blacklist_ktipp_ch.py        | https://www.ktipp.ch       | Switzerland (+41)

The following cronjob will download each day the blacklist provided by ktipp_ch:
```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/share/callblocker/blacklist_ktipp_ch.py --output /etc/callblocker/blacklists/ >/dev/null 2>&1
```
